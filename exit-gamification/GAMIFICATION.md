# Exit – Gamification Strategy Document
**v1.1 | Humane Technology Framework**

---

## Executive Summary

Exit is a premium digital wellbeing app that guides users from compulsive online behavior to intentional presence. Our gamification strategy leverages the **Signal & Static** framework—a physics-inspired system where mindless scrolling creates "Static" (entropy) and conscious actions restore "Clarity" (order). The aesthetic is Quiet Luxury: ethereal, minimal, high-end. The philosophy is Positive Accountability: we make awareness visible, not shameful.

---

## 📊 Research Foundation

This strategy is informed by peer-reviewed research on mobile phone addiction types (Liu et al., 2022) which identified four distinct addiction patterns through interviews with 108 mobile phone addicts and validation across 1,730 adolescents and young adults:

1. **Mobile Social Networking Addiction** → Most correlated with anxiety symptoms
2. **Mobile Gaming Addiction** → Most correlated with depression  
3. **Mobile Information Acquisition Addiction** → Most correlated with reduced life satisfaction
4. **Mobile Short-Form Video Addiction** → Most correlated with sleep disorders

Each addiction type exhibits four core symptoms:
- **Inability to control cravings** (loss of control over usage time)
- **Anxiety and feeling lost** (distress when unable to access)
- **Withdrawal and escape** (using phone to avoid negative emotions)
- **Productivity loss** (negative impact on work/relationships/sleep)

**Key Finding:** While users may have the same overall addiction severity, they exhibit different *types* of problematic use requiring tailored interventions.

## 1. Core Loop: Signal & Static

### The Physics of Attention

**Mental Model:** Your mind is a signal processor. Mindless scrolling adds noise (Static). Deliberate actions clear the signal (Clarity).

### How Static Accumulates

- **1 hour of scrolling** = +30% Static on the Neural Dashboard
- **1.5 hours** = +45% Static
- **2 hours** = System threshold. Visual degradation begins (UI subtly "glitches")
- **App switching >4x in 2h** = +20% Static (context-switching penalty)
- **Opening social media within 30 seconds of pickup** = +10% Static (autopilot trigger)

### The Dashboard Visualization

- **At 0% Static:** Dashboard is pristine, ethereal, calm (soft gradients, smooth animations)
- **At 30% Static:** Subtle visual noise appears (light grain texture, slightly slower transitions)
- **At 60% Static:** Noticeable distortion (heavier grain, muted colors, micro-glitches)
- **At 90% Static:** Dashboard is nearly obscured (heavy interference pattern, red accent pulsing)

**Key Principle:** The interface itself becomes a mirror of your attention state. You feel the chaos you've created.

---

### The Cleaning Mechanism: Dopamine Menu

**Concept:** To restore Clarity, you perform Micro-Actions—brief, offline activities scientifically proven to recalibrate dopamine baselines.

#### The Redemption Formula

- **Clear 30% Static** → Complete **3 Micro-Actions** (10-15 min total)
- **Clear 60% Static** → Complete **6 Micro-Actions** (20-30 min total)
- **Clear 90% Static** → Complete **9 Micro-Actions** OR **1 Deep Action** (30-45 min)

**Micro-Actions (10-15 min each):**
- 5-minute breathwork session (Box Breathing, 4-7-8)
- 10-minute walk without phone (GPS-verified)
- 15-minute reading session (tracked via motion sensors—still, focused)
- Cold water face immersion (30 seconds, self-reported)
- Gratitude journaling (3 entries, text input)
- Creative doodling (timed, no output required)

**Deep Actions (30-45 min):**
- Outdoor exercise (GPS + motion tracking)
- Social IRL time (calendar integration or manual log)
- Skill practice (instrument, cooking, art—timer-based)
- Analog reading (book, magazine—motion stillness)

#### User Flow Example

1. User scrolls Instagram for 90 minutes
2. Dashboard accumulates 45% Static
3. User opens Exit → sees distorted UI + message: *"Your signal is scattered. Clear 45% Static to restore flow."*
4. Selects 5 Micro-Actions from menu
5. Completes 2 (e.g., breathwork + walk)
6. Dashboard clears to 15% Static in real-time (smooth wipe animation)
7. UI returns to calm state
8. Haptic pulse + message: *"Signal restoring. You're finding your way back."*

## 2. Progression System: Levels of Consciousness

### The Five Phases

We track users along a spectrum from unconscious consumption to sovereign attention. Progression is non-linear; users can move up or down based on monthly behavior.

| Level | Title | Description | Upgrade Criteria | UI Aesthetic |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **1** | **The NPC** | "Non-Player Character." High dependency. Autopilot mode. | Initial state (Onboarding) | Muted grays, minimal color, static present |
| **2** | **The Glitch** | "System Error." Awareness building. Catching patterns. | 7 days averaging <3h screen time + 5 Pattern Breaks/week | Soft blues/whites, cleaner transitions |
| **3** | **The Hacker** | "Rewriting the Code." Reclaiming control. Designing routines. | 30 days averaging <2h screen time + 15 Conscious Days | Luminous whites, gold accents, smooth animations |
| **4** | **The Main Character** | "Protagonist Energy." Mastery. Intentional presence. | 60 days averaging <1.5h screen time + 30 Conscious Days + Strong Streak | Warm gradients, particle effects, premium feel |
| **5** | **The Oracle** | "Enlightened Guide." Deep focus. Helping others. | 90 days averaging <1h screen time + 60 Conscious Days + Mentoring in Circle of Trust | Ethereal gradients, prismatic colors, dynamic movement |

### Downgrade Logic

- If user exceeds their level's threshold for **7 consecutive days**, they phase down one level
- **Grace Period:** 2-day buffer before official downgrade (gives time to course-correct)
- Downgrade is framed as *"Your signal is drifting. Let's stabilize."* (Not punitive)

### Level Perks

- **The Glitch:** Unlocks "Pattern Break" customization options
- **The Hacker:** Unlocks "Neural Reset" audio library (brown noise, binaural beats)
- **The Main Character:** Unlocks "Depth Mode" (extended focus sessions with rewards)
- **The Oracle:** Unlocks "Sovereignty Suite" (custom challenges, white-glove analytics, avatar customization)

---

## 3. Daily Quests: The Offline Nudge

### The Smart Suggestion Engine

Daily Quests are **1-2 micro-challenges** designed to pull users into the physical world. They adapt based on:

- **User Level** (NPCs get easier tasks; Oracles get experimental ones)
- **Location Data** (e.g., "Visit a park within 2km" if near green space)
- **Time of Day** (Morning = energy quests; Evening = wind-down quests)
- **Behavioral Patterns** (If user always scrolls at 9 PM, quest triggers at 8:45 PM)

### Quest Categories

#### 1. Presence Quests (Attention)
- **The Morning Pledge:** Don't touch your phone for 1 hour after waking (sound on, no blocking)
- **The Golden Hour:** Go outside during sunset for 15 minutes
- **The Analog Evening:** No screens 1 hour before bed

#### 2. Connection Quests (Social)
- **The Face-to-Face:** Have a 10-minute IRL conversation (self-reported)
- **The Call:** Voice call someone instead of texting
- **The Kindness Drop:** Do one anonymous act of kindness

#### 3. Creation Quests (Agency)
- **The Maker's Block:** Create something with your hands for 20 minutes
- **The Word Sprint:** Write 200 words (journal, letter, story)
- **The Sonic Cleanse:** Listen to one full album without interruptions

#### 4. Restoration Quests (Recovery)
- **The Ice Protocol:** 1-minute cold exposure (shower, face immersion)
- **The Stillness:** 10 minutes of meditation or breathwork
- **The Nature Dose:** 20 minutes outdoors, phone in bag

### Completion Rewards

- **+1 Conscious Day** to streak
- **-10% Static** cleared automatically
- **+50 XP** toward next level threshold
- **Unique badge** (collectible, shown in profile)

### Quest Frequency Logic

- **The NPC:** 1 easy quest/day (15 min max)
- **The Glitch:** 1-2 moderate quests/day (20 min total)
- **The Hacker:** 2 challenging quests/day (30 min total)
- **The Main Character & Oracle:** 2 experimental quests + optional bonus challenges

---

## 4. The Streak: Conscious Days Chain

### What Counts as a Conscious Day?

A day where you:
1. Achieved **3+ Pattern Breaks** (explained below)
2. Kept screen time **below your level's threshold**
3. Cleared any accumulated Static to **<20%**

**Pattern Breaks** = Haptic interruptions that jolt you out of autopilot (more on this in §5).

### The Chain Mechanic

- **Visual:** A golden thread connecting calendar days on the Progress screen
- **Copy:** *"47 Conscious Days. You're weaving a new pattern."*
- **Milestone Rewards:**
  - 7 days → "The First Week" badge + -20% Static bonus
  - 30 days → "The Lunar Cycle" badge + Deep Action Library unlock
  - 90 days → "The Season" badge + Oracle tier preview

### Grace Mode: The Repair Ritual

**Problem:** Perfection is unsustainable. Broken streaks demotivate.

**Solution:** If you break your streak, you can **repair the chain** by completing a **Hard Challenge** within 24 hours.

**Hard Challenges:**
- 3 hours completely offline (GPS + motion verified)
- 10 Micro-Actions in one day
- 1 full day with <30 min screen time (must be tracked start-to-finish)

**If completed:** Chain continues. Badge changes to show "Repaired Link" (gold link with subtle crack—a mark of resilience, not failure).

**If not completed:** Chain resets, but you keep all badges earned. New chain begins next Conscious Day.

---

## 5. Haptic Interruptions: Pattern Breaks

### The Science

Autopilot phone use relies on **habit loops**: cue → routine → reward. By introducing **unexpected sensory disruptions**, we interrupt the loop and force conscious decision-making.

### How It Works

**Pattern Breaks** are brief, non-intrusive haptic/visual nudges that appear during phone usage. Frequency scales with **Addiction Level** (assigned in onboarding).

| Addiction Level | Pattern Break Frequency | Style |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Critical** (4h+ daily) | Every 15 min | Subtle haptic pulse + "Are you here?" overlay (3 sec) |
| **High** (3-4h daily) | Every 25 min | Haptic + soft screen dimming |
| **Moderate** (2-3h daily) | Every 40 min | Haptic only |
| **Low** (<2h daily) | Every 60 min | Optional (user can toggle) |

### The Overlay Message Bank

- *"Still you?"*
- *"What are you looking for?"*
- *"Breathe. Then decide."*
- *"Is this where you want to be?"*
- *"Signal check."*

**Key:** Messages are **questions, not commands**. They invite awareness, not guilt.

### User Control

- Users can snooze Pattern Breaks for 1 hour if genuinely focused
- Snoozing >3x in a day adds +10% Static (consequence without blocking)

---

## 6. Onboarding: The Awakening Sequence

### Philosophy: Progressive Profiling

We don't ask 20 questions upfront. We ask **3 core questions** to determine Addiction Level, then reveal deeper mechanics as users engage.

### The 3-Question Flow

#### Q1: Current State (Visual Selector)

*"How does your phone use feel right now?"*

- 🌫️ **Foggy** → "I pick it up without thinking"
- 🔄 **Looping** → "I know it's too much, but I can't stop"
- ⚖️ **Balanced** → "I'm mostly in control, but want to improve"
- ✨ **Intentional** → "I'm here to optimize, not fix"

→ **Result:** Assigns provisional Addiction Level (Foggy/Looping = Critical; Balanced = Moderate; Intentional = Low)

#### Q2: Screen Time Context (Data Pull + Confirmation)

*"We pulled your recent screen time from iOS."*

- Shows: Avg daily use (last 7 days), most-used apps, pickup count
- Prompt: *"Does this feel accurate? Adjust if needed."*

→ **Result:** Refines Addiction Level based on actual data vs. self-perception gap

#### Q3: Motivation (Value Alignment)

*"What do you want more of?"*

- 🧘 **Presence** → "Being here, not elsewhere"
- 🎯 **Focus** → "Deep work, less distraction"
- 🌱 **Growth** → "New habits, new identity"
- ❤️ **Connection** → "Real relationships, less screen time"

→ **Result:** Customizes Daily Quest themes and Dopamine Menu suggestions

### The First Win (Onboarding Finale)

Before leaving onboarding:
1. User completes **1 Micro-Action** (e.g., 2-minute breathwork guided session)
2. Dashboard clears imaginary Static with smooth wipe animation
3. Haptic celebration + message: *"You just created your first signal. Welcome to clarity."*
4. Unlocks first badge: **"The First Breath"**

**Duration:** <3 minutes. No friction. Immediate value.

### Progressive Disclosure Timeline

| Day | Unlock |
|-----|--------|
| **Day 1** | Core Loop (Signal & Static), Dopamine Menu, first Daily Quest |
| **Day 3** | Pattern Breaks enabled, Streak visible |
| **Day 7** | Level system explained, "Progress toward Glitch" shown |
| **Day 14** | Grace Mode introduced (after first potential streak break) |
| **Day 30** | Full analytics dashboard (weekly reports) |

---

## 7. Weekly Reports: The Neural Audit

### Delivered Every Monday (8 AM local time)

A **calm, data-rich summary** of the previous week. Aesthetic: Notion-style clean tables + soft gradient header.

### Report Sections

#### 1. Signal Quality Score (0-100)

Composite metric:
- **40%** = Average Static Level (lower = better)
- **30%** = Conscious Days count
- **20%** = Pattern Breaks acknowledged (not snoozed)
- **10%** = Quest completion rate

**Visual:** Radial progress chart (Quiet Luxury colors: white → gold)

#### 2. The Ledger

- **Static Accumulated:** Total hours scrolled × 0.5 (converted to %)
- **Clarity Restored:** Total Micro-Actions × 10% (converted to %)
- **Net Position:** Clarity - Static
  - Positive = *"Your signal is strengthening."*
  - Negative = *"You're accumulating noise. This week, prioritize clearing."*

#### 3. Behavioral Insights

- **Peak Scroll Hours:** Heatmap of when you're most vulnerable (e.g., 9-11 PM)
- **App Switching Patterns:** Which app combos trigger binges (e.g., Instagram → TikTok → Instagram loop)
- **Quest Affinity:** Which quest types you complete most (guides future suggestions)

#### 4. Streak Status

- Current chain length
- Historical peak (personal best)
- Next milestone reward (motivator)

#### 5. Level Progress

- **If progressing:** *"You're 4 Conscious Days from Hacker. Keep the momentum."*
- **If stable:** *"You're holding steady. This is the work."*
- **If regressing:** *"Your signal is drifting. Focus on 3 Pattern Breaks daily this week."*

---

## 8. Monthly Recalibration: The Shift

### The Review Moment

At the end of each month, Exit evaluates:
- Average daily screen time (last 30 days)
- Conscious Days count
- Net Static Position (cumulative)
- Quest completion rate

**Outcome:** Level stays, upgrades, or downgrades. UI theme shifts accordingly.

### The Transition Ritual

#### If Upgrading:
1. Full-screen animation (particle dispersion, golden light)
2. Haptic crescendo (builds over 3 seconds)
3. Message: *"You've ascended. Welcome to [New Level Title]."*
4. Dashboard theme shifts in real-time (new colors, smoother animations)
5. Unlocks explained (e.g., new audio library, perks)

#### If Downgrading:
1. Subtle fade-to-gray animation (no dramatic visuals—dignity preserved)
2. Gentle haptic pulse (single, deep)
3. Message: *"Your attention has scattered. We're here to help you find center again."*
4. UI simplifies (back to basics—focus on core loop)
5. Reminder: *"Levels aren't linear. This is part of the path."*

### Why Monthly?

**Weekly** = Too volatile (one bad week shouldn't negate progress)  
**Quarterly** = Too slow (users lose connection between behavior and consequence)  
**Monthly** = Goldilocks zone (enough data to be meaningful, frequent enough to stay engaged)

---

## 9. Avatar & Visual Progression

### The Principle

Your **avatar** is not a cartoon mascot—it's an **abstract visual signature** that evolves with your consciousness level.

### Avatar Design by Level

| Level | Visual Form | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **The NPC** | **Static Cloud** | Amorphous, grayscale, gently pulsing (like visual snow) |
| **The Glitch** | **Fractured Geometry** | Blue/grey geometric fragments, sharp edges, incomplete |
| **The Hacker** | **Code Fragment** | Glowing green/gold wireframe structure, symmetrical |
| **The Main Character** | **Radiant Aura** | Warm orange/gold gradient with dynamic energy trails |
| **The Oracle** | **Light Constellation** | Ethereal particle network, prismatic colors, kinetic movement |

### Where It Appears

- **Dashboard header** (subtly animated)
- **Profile screen** (larger, interactive)
- **Weekly Reports** (static snapshot)
- **Level-up animations** (transforms in real-time)

### Customization (Post-Oracle Only)

Once you reach Oracle, unlock:
- **Color Palette:** Choose base hue (aurora, ember, ocean, monochrome)
- **Particle Density:** Adjust visual complexity
- **Animation Speed:** Slow/moderate/kinetic

**Philosophy:** Customization is *earned*. It's not a Day 1 feature—it's a symbol of mastery.

---

## 10. Anti-Dark-Pattern Safeguards

### Our Red Lines

Exit uses gamification to *empower*, not *exploit*. Here's what we will NOT do:

#### ❌ **No Infinite Feeds**
- The Dopamine Menu is a **finite list** (refreshes daily, not infinite scroll)

#### ❌ **No FOMO Mechanics**
- No limited-time offers that expire in "2 hours!"
- No "Your friend just leveled up!" notifications

#### ❌ **No Punishment Language**
- We don't say "You failed" or "You relapsed"
- Downgrading is "signal drift," not "falling behind"

#### ❌ **No Forced Engagement**
- Pattern Breaks can be snoozed (with minor consequences)
- Daily Quests are suggestions, not requirements (though they help progression)

#### ❌ **No Social Comparison by Default**
- Leaderboards are **opt-in only** (and framed as "Collective Signal," not competition)

### What We Do Instead

✅ **Frame as Exploration:** "Discover what works for you"  
✅ **Celebrate Imperfection:** Grace Mode, repair mechanics  
✅ **Data Transparency:** Show exactly how scores are calculated  
✅ **User Control:** Toggle Pattern Breaks, snooze quests, pause tracking

---

## 11. Success Metrics & Iteration

### North Star Metric

**Conscious Days per Month** (Avg across all users)

**Why:** It's the purest indicator that people are building sustainable attention practices.

### Supporting Metrics

1. **30-Day Retention** (Target: 60%)
2. **Quest Completion Rate** (Target: 70%)
3. **Average Static Clearance Time** (Target: <24h after accumulation)
4. **Level Distribution** (Healthy: 40% Glitch, 30% Hacker, 20% NPC, 10% Main Character/Oracle)
5. **Pattern Break Acknowledgment Rate** (Target: 80% not snoozed)

### A/B Testing Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core Loop Validation** (Month 1-2)
- Test: Static accumulation rate (30% vs. 40% per hour)
- Test: Micro-Action count (3 vs. 5 to clear 30%)

**Phase 2: Quest Optimization** (Month 3-4)
- Test: Quest frequency (1/day vs. 2/day)
- Test: Difficulty scaling (adaptive vs. fixed)

**Phase 3: Progression Tuning** (Month 5-6)
- Test: Level thresholds (7 days vs. 10 days for Glitch)
- Test: Downgrade grace period (2 days vs. 4 days)

### Burnout Watchlist

Monitor weekly for:
- Users consistently ignoring Pattern Breaks (>80% snoozed)
- Users abandoning after downgrading (churn spike)
- Static accumulation without clearance (disengagement)

**Response Protocol:** If detected, trigger **"Recalibration Offer"** (1-on-1 in-app message from "The Exit Team" offering adjusted difficulty)

---

## 12. Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Sources (iOS ScreenTime API)

- Total screen time (daily)
- App-specific usage (per app, per hour)
- Pickups (count, time-stamped)
- Notifications (count, dismissed vs. engaged)

**Frequency:** Pull data every 6 hours (background refresh)

### Haptic Patterns

- **Pattern Break:** Short-short-long (0.1s, 0.1s, 0.3s)
- **Static Accumulation:** Gentle pulse (0.2s, 1x)
- **Clarity Restored:** Crescendo (0.1s → 0.4s over 1 second)
- **Level Up:** Triple burst (0.2s, 0.2s, 0.5s)

### Animation Philosophy

- **Duration:** 0.8-1.2 seconds (never instant, never sluggish)
- **Easing:** Ease-out curves (feel decisive, not robotic)
- **Framerate:** 60fps minimum (requires performance optimization)

### Privacy Commitment

- All screen time data stored **on-device only**
- Cloud sync: Anonymized metrics only (no raw app data)
- User can delete all data instantly (no retention)

---

---

## 14. Core Database Systems

Exit's intelligence relies on two content repositories that power the adaptive experience. These databases are the engine of personalization.

---

### Database 1: The Dopamine Menu (Micro-Actions Repository)

**Purpose:** A curated library of 100+ offline actions scientifically validated to restore dopamine baseline and attention capacity.

#### Tagging Taxonomy

Each Micro-Action is tagged across three dimensions:

**1. Energy Requirement**
- 🟢 **Low (1-3/10):** Minimal physical effort (e.g., breathwork, journaling, listening)
- 🟡 **Medium (4-6/10):** Moderate movement (e.g., stretching, walking, light cleaning)
- 🔴 **High (7-10/10):** Vigorous activity (e.g., running, HIIT, cold plunge)

**2. Context/Location**
- 🏠 **Home:** Doable in private space (no special equipment)
- 💼 **Work:** Office-appropriate (quiet, professional)
- 🌳 **Outside:** Requires outdoor access
- 🚗 **Transit:** Doable in car/train (passive activities)
- 🎯 **Anywhere:** No location constraints

**3. Duration**
- ⚡ **Quick (5-10 min)**
- ⏱️ **Standard (10-20 min)**
- ⏳ **Extended (20-30 min)**

#### Smart Matching Algorithm

When user needs to clear Static, the system suggests actions based on:
- **Current context** (GPS location: home/work/outdoor)
- **Time of day** (Morning = higher energy tolerance; Evening = wind-down preference)
- **User energy level** (self-reported or inferred from activity patterns)
- **Weather** (if outside actions, check local conditions)
- **Completion history** (avoid suggesting same action 3x in a week)

**Example Logic:**
```
IF user_location = "home"
AND time = "evening"
AND energy_level = "low"
AND weather = "raining"
THEN suggest: [Low Energy × Home × Quick]

→ Results: "Box Breathing (5 min)", "Gratitude Journaling", "Gentle Stretching"
```

#### Sample Dopamine Menu Entries (20 examples)

| Action | Energy | Context | Duration | Static Cleared | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Box Breathing** | Low | Anywhere | Quick | 10% | 4-4-4-4 pattern, guided audio |
| **Gratitude Journaling** | Low | Home/Work | Quick | 10% | Write 3 things, no typing |
| **Cold Face Immersion** | Low | Home | Quick | 15% | 30 sec, ice water bowl |
| **Stretching Flow** | Medium | Home | Standard | 15% | 8 poses, hold 30 sec each |
| **Phone-Free Walk** | Medium | Outside | Standard | 20% | GPS verified, 10 min minimum |
| **Single-Task Reading** | Low | Anywhere | Standard | 15% | Physical book/magazine, 15 min |
| **Creative Doodling** | Low | Home/Work | Quick | 10% | Pen + paper, no output judgment |
| **Mindful Tea Ritual** | Low | Home/Work | Quick | 10% | Brew slowly, no multitasking |
| **Power Nap** | Low | Home | Standard | 15% | 15-20 min, set alarm |
| **Voice Call (No Video)** | Medium | Anywhere | Standard | 20% | Real conversation, 10+ min |
| **Yoga Sun Salutations** | Medium | Home | Standard | 20% | 5 rounds, guided optional |
| **Brown Noise Bath** | Low | Home | Extended | 15% | 20 min, headphones, eyes closed |
| **Cold Shower** | High | Home | Quick | 25% | 1-2 min, gradual temp drop |
| **Freewriting** | Low | Home/Work | Standard | 15% | 10 min, stream of consciousness |
| **Organized Decluttering** | Medium | Home | Standard | 20% | Clear 1 surface/drawer |
| **Meal Prep (Mindful)** | Medium | Home | Extended | 25% | Cook from scratch, no screens |
| **Nature Sit** | Low | Outside | Standard | 20% | Sit still 15 min, observe |
| **Jump Rope** | High | Home/Outside | Quick | 20% | 5 min, high intensity |
| **Analog Music Listening** | Low | Home/Transit | Extended | 15% | Full album, no skipping |
| **Hand-Written Letter** | Low | Home | Standard | 20% | To anyone, pen + paper |

#### Database Structure (JSON Example)

```json
{
  "id": "act_047",
  "name": "Box Breathing",
  "description": "4-4-4-4 breathing pattern to activate parasympathetic nervous system",
  "energy": "low",
  "context": ["home", "work", "outside", "transit"],
  "duration_min": 5,
  "duration_max": 10,
  "static_cleared": 10,
  "instructions": "Inhale 4 counts, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Repeat 5 cycles.",

  "unlock_level": "npc",
  "seasonal_boost": ["winter"],
  "tags": ["stress_relief", "immediate", "beginner_friendly"]
}
```

#### Content Curation Principles

- **Evidence-Based:** Each action links to peer-reviewed research on dopamine/attention restoration
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** No actions requiring specific religious/cultural practices
- **Accessibility:** 30% of menu is mobility-friendly (no standing/walking required)
- **Seasonality:** Some actions boost in relevance (e.g., "Outdoor Walk" in spring)
- **Progression:** Advanced actions unlock at Hacker/Main Character/Oracle levels (e.g., "Ice Bath Protocol")

#### Refresh Cadence

- **Daily:** Menu re-sorts based on context (morning vs. evening suggestions)
- **Weekly:** 10 new "Featured Actions" rotate in
- **Monthly:** Seasonal actions gain prominence (e.g., winter = more indoor activities)

---

### Database 2: Daily Quests Repository (Challenge Templates)

**Purpose:** A library of 80+ quest templates that adapt to user level, location, time, and behavioral patterns. Quests are designed to interrupt phone-centric routines and create offline momentum.

#### Quest Template Structure

Each quest includes:
- **Name:** Memorable, intriguing title (e.g., "The Morning Pledge")
- **Category:** Presence / Connection / Creation / Restoration
- **Difficulty:** Easy / Moderate / Challenging / Mastery
- **Unlock Level:** Which user level can access this quest
- **Duration:** Expected time commitment
- **Verification:** How completion is tracked (GPS, timer, self-report, calendar integration)
- **Contextual Triggers:** When/where this quest is most relevant

#### Sample Daily Quest Templates (25 examples)

| Quest Name | Category | Difficulty | Duration | Unlock Level | Verification | Description |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **The Morning Pledge** | Presence | Easy | 1 hour | NPC | Honor system | Don't touch phone for 1h after waking (sound on, no flight mode) |
| **The Golden Hour** | Presence | Easy | 15 min | NPC | GPS + time | Go outside during sunrise or sunset |
| **The Face-to-Face** | Connection | Moderate | 10 min | NPC | Self-report | Have an IRL conversation (not work-related) |
| **The Analog Evening** | Presence | Moderate | 1 hour | Glitch | Screen time check | No screens 1h before bed |

#### Contextual Trigger Logic

Quests are suggested based on:

**Time-Based Triggers:**
- **Morning (6-10 AM):** Energy-building quests (Morning Pledge, Dawn Departure, Coffee Meditation)
- **Midday (11 AM-2 PM):** Connection/creation quests (Lunch Away, Word Sprint, Face-to-Face)
- **Evening (6-10 PM):** Wind-down quests (Analog Evening, Sonic Cleanse, Sensory Shower)
- **Weekend:** Extended quests (Micro-Adventure, Museum Wander, Culinary Deep Work)

**Location-Based Triggers:**
- **Near parks:** Nature Dose, Sidewalk Stroll
- **Near cultural venues:** Museum Wander, Bookshop Hour
- **At home (evening):** Maker's Block, Analog Game Night
- **Commuting:** Tech-Free Transit, Coffee Meditation

**Behavioral Triggers:**
- **If user always scrolls at 9 PM:** Quest triggers at 8:45 PM (Analog Evening, Stillness)
- **If user picks up phone immediately upon waking:** Morning Pledge suggested
- **If user has 5+ app switches in an hour:** Quest interrupts loop (Face-to-Face, Nature Dose)

**Adaptive Difficulty:**
- **NPC:** Only Easy quests (15-20 min max)
- **Glitch:** Easy + Moderate (up to 1h)
- **Hacker:** All except Mastery (up to 2h)
- **Main Character & Oracle:** All quests + custom challenges

#### Quest Rotation & Freshness

**Daily Selection Algorithm:**
1. **Pull user profile:** Level, location, time, recent completion history
2. **Filter eligible quests:** Match difficulty, context, unlock level
3. **Score by relevance:** Weight by behavioral triggers, weather, time of day
4. **Select 2 quests:** 1 Primary (highest score) + 1 Alternate (different category)
5. **Prevent repetition:** No quest repeated within 7 days unless user requests

**Monthly Themes:**
- **January:** "Digital Detox Month" (more Presence quests)
- **February:** "Connection Month" (more Connection quests)
- **March:** "Creation Month" (more Creation quests)
- **April:** "Restoration Month" (more nature/outdoor quests)
- Cycle repeats quarterly

**Bonus Quests (Weekend/Holiday):**
- Longer, immersive challenges (3-6 hours)
- Higher rewards (2x XP, unique badges)
- Examples: "The Saturday Unplug" (6h offline), "The Sunday Reset" (full analog day)

#### User-Generated Quests (Oracle Tier)

Oracle users can create **Custom Quests:**
- Set their own rules, duration, verification
- Share with community (opt-in, moderated)
- If popular (20+ completions), may be added to official database
- Incentive: Creator gets "Quest Architect" badge

## Final Design Philosophy

Exit doesn't gamify phone addiction—it gamifies **recovery from phone addiction**. The difference is intent. Every mechanic serves the mission: **Online → Offline**.

The Signal & Static loop mirrors the user's real mental state. The Dopamine Menu teaches them they have agency. The levels show them progress is possible. The quests pull them into the world.

**The two databases are the heart of the system:** The Dopamine Menu provides the tools for restoration; the Daily Quests create the momentum for transformation.

This is gamification as *pedagogy*, not manipulation. We're teaching people how to reclaim their attention, one conscious day at a time.

**The endgame is not engagement. It's sovereignty.**
