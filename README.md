#  Project Exit: The Master Plan

> "The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection." — Johann Hari

###  The Problem
We are living through a **Mass Attention Crisis**.
* **The Rot:** Gen Z is spending 6+ hours/day in "Functional Freeze" (scrolling while physically paralyzed).
* **The Failure:** Existing tools (Opal, One Sec) treat this as a "Productivity" issue. They act like a Nanny.
* **The Truth:** This is a **Nervous System** issue. You doomscroll because your cortisol is high, and the screen is your pacifier.

###  The Solution: Somatic Bridging
We are building **Exit**, a "Digital Survival Kit" that uses **Somatic Interventions** to break the dopamine loop.
We don't just block the app. We force you to **pay a toll** with your body.
* Want to open TikTok? **Do 15 squats.**
* Want to check Instagram? **Take 3 deep breaths.**

We replace cheap dopamine (scrolling) with expensive dopamine (movement).

###  The Roadmap
* [ ] **Phase 1: The Somatic Shield (iOS)** - *In Progress*
    * Building the "Deep Link Hack" to connect Screen Time API with CoreMotion sensors.
* [ ] **Phase 2: The Neural Ledger**
    * Visualizing screen time as "Static/Noise" that blurs your dashboard.
* [ ] **Phase 3: The Dopamine Menu**
    * AI-driven suggestions for offline micro-actions (e.g., "Drink Water", "Draw a Circle").
