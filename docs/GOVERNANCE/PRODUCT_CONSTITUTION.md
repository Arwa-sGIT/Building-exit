# THE PRODUCT CONSTITUTION

**Status:** IMMUTABLE  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 2, 2026

---

## ARTICLE I: MISSION

**We build armor for the human brain against algorithmic aggression.**

Exit is a physiological interrupt system that trains awareness, not abstinence. We do not block access—we interrupt autopilot.

---

## ARTICLE II: PRIMARY OUTCOME

**Reduce non-intentional screen time by 50% within 90 days.**

Success is measured by:
- Conscious Days per month (target: 20+)
- Intervention acceptance rate (target: 70%+)
- User-reported improvement in presence (qualitative)

---

## ARTICLE III: CORE PHILOSOPHY

### We Believe:

1. **Awareness Over Abstinence**  
   The goal is not to eliminate phone use—it's to make phone use *intentional*. We train users to ask "Why am I here?" before they scroll.

2. **Physiology Over Willpower**  
   Dopamine dysregulation is a nervous system problem, not a moral failing. We use somatic interventions (breathing, movement) to break the loop.

3. **Maintenance Over Debt**  
   Screen time is not "debt" you owe back. It's entropy that naturally accumulates. Our job is to provide tools for restoration, not shame.

4. **Invisible Design**  
   The app should feel like it was built by Apple. Standard components, San Francisco font, system colors. Users should trust it immediately because it looks native.

---

## ARTICLE IV: ANTI-GOALS (What We Will NOT Do)

### We Do Not:

❌ **Build Passive Dashboards**  
We are not a data visualization tool. Seeing your screen time stats alone does not change behavior. We require action.

❌ **Use Shame Language**  
No terms like "debt," "addict," "failure," "relapse," "punishment," or "penalty." Our language is neutral and physics-based: Signal, Static, Clarity, Entropy, Restoration.

❌ **Create Infinite Feeds**  
The Dopamine Menu is finite (refreshed daily). No algorithmic content streams. No endless scroll.

❌ **Gamify Engagement**  
We do not use FOMO mechanics ("Your friend just leveled up!"), limited-time offers, or social comparison leaderboards. Progression is personal.

❌ **Harvest User Data**  
Raw screen time data never leaves the device. Only anonymized aggregate statistics (e.g., "Clarity Score: 65%") are synced to cloud.

## ARTICLE V: DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

### The Native iOS Standard:

1. **Typography:** San Francisco (system font only)
2. **Colors:** System colors (Light/Dark adaptive)
3. **Components:** UIKit/SwiftUI patterns (standard iOS controls)
4. **Icons:** SF Symbols (Apple's icon set)
5. **Motion:** Subtle, standard iOS transitions (no custom particle effects)

**Goal:** Users should not be able to tell this wasn't made by Apple.

---

## ARTICLE VI: BEHAVIORAL AXIOMS

### Universal Truths We Design Around:

1. **Autopilot is the default state.**  
   80% of phone pickups are unconscious. Our job is to insert a "pause" before the loop starts.

2. **Friction must be physiological, not cognitive.**  
   Asking "Are you sure?" doesn't work. Making users breathe or move *does* work.

3. **Context determines action.**  
   Suggesting "Go for a run" at 11 PM is useless. Suggesting "Brown noise" works. The system must be situationally aware.

4. **Progression must be visible but not punitive.**  
   Users need to see their improvement (Levels, Streaks), but downgrading must not feel like failure. It's "Signal drift," not "falling behind."

---

## ARTICLE VII: SUCCESS CRITERIA

### We Know We've Succeeded When:

✅ **30-Day Retention:** 60%+ of onboarded users are still active  
✅ **Conscious Days:** Average user achieves 20+ Conscious Days/month  
✅ **Intervention Acceptance:** 70%+ of Shields result in completed actions  
✅ **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** 50+ after 14 days  
✅ **Qualitative Signal:** Users report "I feel more present" in surveys

## ARTICLE VIII: AMENDMENT PROCESS

This Constitution may only be amended by consensus of:
- Product Lead

- Behavioral Psychologist Advisor

Amendments require written justification and must not violate Articles I-IV (Mission, Outcome, Philosophy, Anti-Goals).
